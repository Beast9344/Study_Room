Study Room: A Virtual Collaborative Learning Environment
An interactive web application designed to provide a dedicated virtual space for students and teachers to collaborate, share resources, and enhance the online learning experience.

About The Project
_______________________________________________________
The "Study Room" project was developed to address the challenges of online education, such as student isolation and lack of engagement. Unlike general-purpose video conferencing tools, this platform integrates all essential academic collaboration tools into a single, user-friendly environment. It provides subject-specific rooms, real-time communication, and resource sharing to create a focused and productive study atmosphere.
The system is built on a client-server model using a lightweight and scalable tech stack, ensuring accessibility and reliability.
